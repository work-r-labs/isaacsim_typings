    """
    Compute the coordinates for drawing directed graphs following the method
        developed by Sugiyama.
    
        This method consists of four phases:
        1. Cycle Removal
        2. Layer Assignment
        3. Crossing Reduction
        4. Coordinate Assignment
    
        As input it takes the list of edges in the following format:
        [(vertex1, vertex2), (vertex3, vertex4), ... ]
    
        Once the object is created, it's possible to get the node layer number
        immediately.
    
        To get the node positions, it's necessary to set each node's size and
        call `update_positions`.
